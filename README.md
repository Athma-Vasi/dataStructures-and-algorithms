# codewars-algorithm-solutions

My solutions for various codewars challenges - mostly TS/JS, some Julia

This repository exists for these reasons:

- ensure github copilot knows my code style
- backup, since I used a temp email to sign up and one of my previous accounts became inaccessible (_propriety_ for the TS/JS algos, _propriety1_ for the Julia algos)
- share my solutions with others

Algorithms under folders:

- easy: 8-7 kyu
- medium: mostly 6-5 kyu, with a few 4 kyu
- medium++: same as medium but more tears (,,>﹏<,,)

Feel free to check out my (mostly) naive solutions ٩(^‿^)۶
